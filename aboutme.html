      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to remain somewhat anonymous, so I won't say my name, but I can tell you that I am a student of computer engineering and video game design and development, passionate about web pages, artificial intelligence and above all, films and animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I currently have seen almost 700 films in my life and I still have 430 pending! But let's just say that I have a wide range of films to recommend and not only that, but in my career I have also had modules dedicated to the cinema and storytelling. I have studied fields as the script, the narrative resources in the cinema, the structure of a movie, the key points as the soundtrack, the transitions, camera positions, environmental storytelling, and so on.
      </p>
      <h3>Why cinephile?</h3>
      <img id="about-image" src="images/background.jpg" width="400px">
      <p>
        I decided to create this webpage because I've been many times looking for recommended films in platforms such as Netflix not really finding what I wanted for that moment. Becuase of that, everytime someone asks me for advice or recommendations of films, always before recommending I ask them exactly what they want to see or how they feel at that moment, so that the film transmits them as much as possible and they enjoy it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why the page is divided into recommendations based on what you really want to see. It is necessary to remember that this page is relatively new and that there are not many movies yet, but soon there will be more.
      </p>
      <h3>So what?</h3>
      <p>
        Therefore, I invite you to look for a movie that catches your attention within the recommendations and if you have seen one that does not appear in the catalog, feel free to recommend it to me in the <a href="contact.html"><i>contact</i></a> site!
